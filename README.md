# Translation Search Chrome Plugin

Simple configurable Chrome extension which adds the option to search highlighted text in Wiktionary and/or translate it through DeepL to assist with language learning.

## Capabilities

This plugin provides two functionalities through the right click menu in the chrome browser.

- Searching [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) for highlighted text.
- Translating highlighted text using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator)

I have created this plugin to assist me with looking up words and phrases as I learn a new language (German, if you're curious). I have found that I often reference Wiktionary for single words, and DeepL for phrases.

## Installing

To install this extension to your browser:

- Download the latest release (.zip file).
- Extract the .zip file to a directory of your choice.
- Open Google Chrome.
- Go to the **Extensions Page** (you can do this by navigating to this link `chrome://extensions/`).
- Enable **Developer Mode** using the toggle switch at the top right of the page.
- Click "Load unpacked".
- Find and select the folder which contains the extracted contents of the .zip file.
- The extension should appear in your list of extensions.

## Configurability

One thing that I really care for is the customizability that this plugin provides. This happens in two axes:

- Choosing which of the two options will be displayed in the right click menu.
- Selecting the source and target language that DeepL will use for translating.

All of these can be configured through the options menu in the Extension Manager.

The first option is important because Chrome automatically groups both options under a single submenu, if both are available. This means it takes slightly more time to select the option you need, because you need to hover over the parent menu and wait for the sub-options to appear. If you find yourself overwhelmingly using one option over the other, it might be best for you to disable one of the two to make it more convenient to use.

### Happy Language Learning :D
